                Establish ASPIRE as a world-leading development institution

              <p className="mt-4 text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                ASPIRE’s opportunity exists in positioning the district as a
                globally influential and impactful region. International best
                practice promoted by institutions such as the United Nations,
                World Economic Forum, World Bank, etc. have integrated
                development initiatives with drivers for change. ASPIRE, in
                establishing itself as world-leading development institution,
                will position the district as a leader in development on a SMART
                rural vision and mandate. Key areas of focus will be the
                implementation of best practice methodologies at an
                implementation level across all Development Pillars. ASPIRE will
                also aim to promote the district at an international level,
                through best practice, as a leader in piloting global solutions
                to rural areas using SMART approaches. The success of ASPIRE’s
                mandate is linked to strong domestic and international
                partnerships that will unlock the technical skills and resources
                needed to effect implementation of interventions. A service-led
                productive entity will ensure consistent alignment to the
                districts’ vision, as well as transparent and accountable
                administration to local municipalities, civil society, and
                private sector.

                Promote Innovative industry value chain enterprise growth
              </h2>

              <p className="mt-4 text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                Regional industry value chain enterprise growth will be realised
                through the stimulation growth and expansion of existing value
                chains, and introduction of new value chains, within the
                district. The fourth industrial revolution has seen significant
                changes to industry value chains, as well as the introduction of
                new industries. Historically, transformation of these value
                chains has been difficult. The disruption created by the fourth
                industrial revolution has created an opportunity for the
                district to leap-frog development and transformation of these
                value chains. Hence, ASPIRE will facilitate the transformation
                of new generation value chains through enterprise development
                initiatives, transformational partnerships domestically and
                internationally. ASPIRE will market the district as an
                international ‘sand- box’ for research and development for SMART
                rural solutions within the scope of the Development Pillars.
                Research and development will provide a catalyst for growth,
                expansion and introduction of new value chains birthed within
                the district. Innovative research and development and value
                chain augmentation will contribute to job/skills recalibration
                to future industry needs. Hence, the District citizen will have
                the opportunity to enter, and be aligned to future industry
                skills needs increasing work opportunities. Government, private
                sector, and citizens will have the opportunity to cohesively
                grow into the fourth industrial revolution optimally.

                Optimize the socio-economic value of District-owned
                infrastructure assets

              <p className="mt-4 text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                The assets of the district serve as a critical socio-economic
                game changer. ASPIRE will facilitate the link between current
                assets and their socio-economic benefit, to innovative
                partnerships. There is a lack of both social and economic
                infrastructure and high backlog issues for the development
                nodes. Limited resources for new infrastructure require
                innovative approaches to infrastructure development. The
                Infrastructure Pillar covers rural roads, transport and logistic
                networks improvement, and rural service provision, whilst Social
                and Human Development covers coordinating and improving access
                to quality services, as well as building vibrant, caring, and
                cohesive communities. The district will realise socio- economic
                revenue from repurposed or rehabilitated assets. ASPIRE will
                implement high-impact infrastructure transformation projects
                which will be managed and implemented using global best practice
                methodologies, and secured through sound investment
                partnerships. Key projects will include District-wide
                environmentally sustainable innovative road connectivity,
                renewable energy, waste management and water security, etc.

                Promote ADM as a domestic and international investment location

                At a national level, investment within South Africa has been
                identified as a key area of focus to pursue economic growth, in
                turn improving the social impact. ASPIRE aims to align to this
                national imperative by positioning the district as a strategic
                region for investment both locally and internationally. By
                partnering with strategic players, ASPIRE will market the SMART
                rural model to drive investment into the province. The value of
                land and agrarian transformation in the rural economy is
                significant to investors. The promotion of viable partnerships
                towards production, processing, and exporting of agricultural
                products will not only address food security, but also stimulate
                the economy of the region. Hence, improved social and human
                development will be a tangible outcome.

              <p className="mt-4 text-xs text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                The focus will be on current and new industry sectors pursuing a
                transformation objective. Fundamental to investment promotion of
                the region is the ability of the district to improve the ease of
                doing business. One-stop facilities across the district will
                provide necessary support and linkages to facilitate
                investment-driven partnerships. Furthermore, partnerships and
                co-operation agreements will restore investment value to the
                districts’ natural, heritage and cultural resources, thereby
                catalyzing growth in investment.
